# Vyges Community

Welcome to the Vyges community repository! This is the central hub for all discussions, issues, feature requests, and community interactions related to the Vyges platform.

## What is Vyges?

Vyges is the developer-first platform for reusable open-source hardware IP. We're building the missing ecosystem layer that makes chip design as fast and composable as software development.

**Our Mission**: Democratize chip design by unifying open-source IP, developer tooling, and supply chain transparency.
